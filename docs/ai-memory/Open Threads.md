# Open Threads

This file records verified defects and clearly unresolved engineering work. Runtime-test failures are evidence for exercised behavior; static or compatibility findings remain labeled as unresolved until verified.

## Completed baseline: core-service authentication hardening

Core-service authentication hardening is complete. The authentication baseline improved from 22/31 passing tests before remediation to 31/31 afterward.

- Missing roles no longer default to administrator; issuer and audience are enforced.
- Route declarations using legacy `tech` are canonicalized to `technician`, while tokens claiming `tech` are rejected.
- Sensitive authentication/user/password-hash logging was removed, and `/auth/profile` uses the canonical hardened middleware.
- Existing tokens lacking valid issuer/audience claims or claiming `tech` may require reauthentication.
- Verification also passed the full contract-service suite (7/7 suites, 100/100 tests), the core-service suite (1/1 suite, 3/3 tests), syntax checks, and `git diff --check` under system Node 18 using isolated MongoMemoryServer databases. No real database was modified.

## Contract and data compatibility

### Wayne Healthcare financial discrepancy

- `WHC-CAM-2024-001` has candidate baseline `$94,881.90`, ledger result `$383,524.75`, and stored `totalValue` `$383,524.74`.
- No authoritative repository source explains the penny difference.
- Do not repair until external commercial evidence resolves it; do not guess or round it away.

### Historical `linkedWorkOrders`

- `WorkOrder.contractId` is authoritative for active behavior.
- `Contract.linkedWorkOrders` remains because local read-only inspection found 36 references on one historical Contract.
- Removing it requires an explicit compatibility and migration decision.

### Multi-replica lifecycle execution

- Contract lifecycle operations are idempotent and same-process overlap is prevented.
- `noOverlap` is not a distributed lock; multiple replicas could race. Current Compose does not declare replicas.
- Do not add distributed infrastructure without explicit deployment evidence and authorization.

### Unmounted Customer/Vendor modules

- Contract-service Customer/Vendor implementations remain unmounted.
- Core-service appears to own active Vendor/Customer behavior, but external compatibility and historical ownership are not sufficiently proven for deletion.

## Other unresolved security/data risks

### Existing legacy `tech` records

Whether operational data contains legacy `tech` user records, and which callers depend on that value, remains unknown. Any assessment or normalization requires explicit database authorization.

### Possible existing plaintext-password records

The historical registration path could store plaintext passwords. Model middleware protects ordinary future `save` operations, but existing data was not inspected or migrated.

### `customerId` registration and tenant behavior

Registration requires `customerId` for customers, while static inspection previously found no corresponding current `User` schema/token field. Persistence and tenant behavior require a separate tenant-sensitive investigation.

### Password writes bypassing Mongoose save middleware

The hashing invariant applies to ordinary `save`; update, bulk, import, or direct-collection paths may bypass it and require deliberate review.

## Environment and dependency maintenance

- Authentication verification ran under system Node 18; test tooling recommends Node `>=20.19`, and previous Cronus verification succeeded under Node 22. Runtime standardization remains future environment maintenance.
- Dependency vulnerability remediation remains deferred. Do not run `npm audit fix` automatically.
- Node runtime and dependency-directory ownership cleanup remain environment maintenance, separate from product/security commits.

## CRM / Strategic Account Management deferred work

The Phase 1 architecture and policies are accepted, and Phase 1A Contact backend implementation in `core-service` is complete and verified. The following items remain genuinely deferred or unresolved; they do not reopen the accepted Phase 1 policies or Phase 1A invariants.

### Vendor ownership and tenant behavior

- Static inspection found inconsistent authentication and Facility/tenant scoping in active core-service Vendor routes. The active Vendor schema uses `tenantId`, but current JWT context does not establish that identifier, and unmounted contract-service Vendor code creates an unresolved ownership boundary.
- Runtime verification and an explicit ownership/tenant policy are required before CRM depends on Vendor references.
- This prerequisite did not block Contact implementation. Future CRM work must avoid Vendor dependencies until it is resolved.
- Do not revive unmounted Customer/Vendor implementations or add cross-service Vendor writes implicitly.

### Deferred authorization and Organization capabilities

- Phase 1 uses canonical `admin`, `technician`, `customer`, and `viewer` roles. A granular CRM capability/role system is deferred until actual usage requires it.
- Organization-wide views may aggregate only already-authorized Facilities. Separate Organization-wide authorization grants are deferred.

### Deferred CRM workflows

- Contact duplicate detection produces warnings only. An audited Contact merge workflow is deferred.
- Interactions retain creator/updater and timestamps, but a formal retention policy and retention workflow are deferred.
- Automatic Opportunity-to-Contract draft handoff is deferred. A manually created Contract may later be linked without rewriting Opportunity history.

### Deferred signals

- Percentile/high-service-cost and trend signals are deferred until production history supports meaningful thresholds.
- Facility-wide uncovered-equipment, rising-cost, repeated-failure, and aging-concentration signals require efficient queries and accepted business definitions before implementation.
